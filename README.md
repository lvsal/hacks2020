The big boy repo for the team "Algorithm Peasants"

Surely this maginificant team will be able to conquer all and commit their big brains onto only the greatest of tasks.


A webapp that defines the rooms in the UOFC Mac Hall. Essentially built to be a form of "social media"/ reddit type format for the university tool "Roomfinder". 

We tried to make reddit + google maps.

To run the app, go into pyscripts and do ~ python3 app.py
    (requires various libraries)

Program was built using - flask/python3/html/css/js/leaflet
